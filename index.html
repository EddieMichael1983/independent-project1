    <p> <strong>About me:</strong> I'm a new student in the Intro to Programming class. I'm also a guitarist, saxophonist, DJ and music teacher. You can hear a demo version of one of my songs <strong><a href="https://www.bandlab.com/976evileddie/ym-practice-f58ec679">here</a></strong>. I love traveling and my most recent trips were to L.A. and New Orleans. In New Orleans I explored the Barataria Preserve, the Garden District, and Magazine Street. I took a steamboat tour sailing down the Mississippi River. In L.A. we stayed in a building downtown that had a pool and a hot tub on the roof! On our first night there we took photo booth pictures at a bar. We also hiked to the Hollywood sign and saw a bicycle parade on the Santa Monica pier.</p>
